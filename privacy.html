   <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
   <p>This Android application was built by <a href="https://github.com/poke">Patrick Westerhoff</a> as a free and open
    source software, published under the <a href="https://github.com/poke/tweeplusreader/blob/master/LICENSE">GNU

   <h2>Data collection</h2>
   <p>twee+ reader does not collect <em>any</em> data about its users, neither directly or indirectly.</p>
   <p>The application only registers an <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters">intent
    handler</a> which is used to intercept actions that want to open a browser for twee+ URLs at
    <code>tweeplus.com</code>. This is done without actually opening a network connection through which data could
    be distributed. The application keeps any and all activity completely offline without communicating with any
    remote server.</p>
   <p>As such, no activity regarding the opened twee+ links, or other Twitter/X activity or profile information
    will be shared with first or third parties. Any information remains on the Android device.</p>
